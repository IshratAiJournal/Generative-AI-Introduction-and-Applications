📘 Module 01 Completed – *Introduction and Capabilities of Generative AI*

 🔑 Key Learnings:
- **Generative AI vs. Discriminative AI**  
  - Discriminative AI → mimics analytical & predictive skills.  
  - Generative AI → mimics human **creative** skills (creating new content).

- **Core Capabilities of Generative AI:**
  - Generates new **text, images, code, audio, video**.
  - Creates **synthetic data** to augment datasets.
  - Builds **avatars, digital personalities, and virtual worlds**.
  - Completes or generates **code**.

- **Important Models & Techniques:**
  - **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** → generator vs discriminator.
  - **VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)** → latent space sampling.
  - **Transformers & LLMs** → like GPT, Gemini, Watsonx.
  - **Diffusion models** → noise-to-image generation.

- **Applications Across Domains:**
  - Entertainment (art, music, storytelling 🎨🎶).
  - Healthcare (drug discovery, diagnosis 🏥).
  - Business (automation, customer support 💼).
  - Education, HR, Finance, and more.

### 🧪 Hands-on Lab Experience:
- Explored **Generative AI Classroom** powered by multiple models.
- Practiced **prompting techniques** → how specificity in prompts affects outputs.
- Compared responses from different LLMs.
- Understood strengths & weaknesses of generative tools.

### 📝 Reflection:
This module helped me connect the **history, evolution, and fundamentals** of Generative AI with its **real-world applications**.
I also gained **hands-on confidence** in prompting and generating content. Feels like a strong foundation to build upon for the next modules. 🚀
