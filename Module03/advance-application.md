# Generative AI: Introduction and Applications üöÄ

## Overview

This repository showcases my learning journey in **Generative AI**, covering three comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: Introduction to Generative AI**
   - Understanding **generative vs. discriminative AI**
   - Applications across industries: IT, finance, healthcare, education, HR, entertainment
   - AI Agents: proactive AI systems capable of goal-driven actions
   - Hands-on lab: generating text with ChatGPT

2. **Module 2: Image & Code Generation**
   - **Text Generation:** ChatGPT and Google Gemini for conversational flow, content creation, and translation
   - **Image Generation:** DALL¬∑E, Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN for text-to-image, inpainting, style transfer, and photorealistic rendering
   - **Code Generation:** GitHub Copilot, PolyCoder, ChatGPT for writing, converting, and optimizing code
   - Hands-on labs: 
     - Generating ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in C and converting code to Python
     - Creating images from text prompts
   - Key takeaway: **Generative AI can create content, while discriminative AI classifies and predicts data**

3. **Module 3: Advanced Applications**
   - Real-world applications: customer support chatbots, personalized education, marketing content, anomaly detection in IT, fraud detection in banking
   - Exploring AI tools for creative and technical tasks:
     - **Text:** ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Jasper, Copy.ai, Writesonic
     - **Images:** DALL¬∑E, Adobe Firefly, Bing Image Creator
     - **Code:** GitHub Copilot, PolyCoder, IBM Watson Code
     - **Audio & Video:** LOVO, AudioCraft, Runway Gen-1/Gen-2
   - Hands-on labs:
     - Generate web page code
     - Create photorealistic product images
     - Detect anomalies in software using AI tools
